Day 62: Working with files and directories using loops
Loops = repeat a task for many files/folders.

Example 1: Print all text files
for file in *.txt; do
  echo "Found: $file"
done

➡️ If you have 5 .txt files, it prints each one.

Example 2: Create folders in bulk
for i in {1..3}; do
  mkdir "folder_$i"
done

➡️ Makes: folder_1, folder_2, folder_3.
