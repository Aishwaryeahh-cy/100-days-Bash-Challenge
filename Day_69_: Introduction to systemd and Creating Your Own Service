systemd is the system manager that starts services when your Linux machine boots.
Services are defined in unit files (ending with .service).
Example service file:
/etc/systemd/system/mybackup.service
[Unit]
Description=My Backup Service
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/home/user/backup.sh
Restart=on-failure
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Then you run:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mybackup.service
sudo systemctl start mybackup.service

Now your backup script runs automatically like a real Linux service!
