Day 2: Basic Navigation in the Linux Terminal: pwd, ls, and cd.

1. pwd - Print Working Directory
   Definition: The pwd command stands for "print working directory". It shows you the full path of your current directory.
Example: /home/aishu/Downloads

2. ls - List Directory Contents
   Definition: The ls command lists the files and directories in your current directory. 
Example: ls, ls -a(for hidden files), ls -lh(for information in human readable format), ls -l (to provide information in a more detailed way)

3. cd - Change Directory
   Definition: The cd command allows you to change the current directory you're working in.
Example:cd Desktop, cd Downloads.
*Move back to the previous directory:
$ cd ..
*Go directly to your home directory:
$ cd or cd ~
Both will take you to the home directory, regardless of where you are.
*Go to an absolute path:
$ cd /home/user/Downloads
