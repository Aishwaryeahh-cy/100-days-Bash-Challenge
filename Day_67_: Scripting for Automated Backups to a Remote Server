Idea: Write a script that copies files from your machine to another (remote) machine automatically.
In Linux, we often use scp (secure copy) or rsync for backups.
Suppose you want to back up /home/user/data to another server at 192.168.1.50 under the user backupuser.

Example script:
#!/bin/bash
# backup.sh
# Source and destination
SOURCE_DIR="/home/user/data"
DEST_USER="backupuser"
DEST_HOST="192.168.1.50"
DEST_DIR="/backups/data"
# Run backup
rsync -avz $SOURCE_DIR ${DEST_USER}@${DEST_HOST}:$DEST_DIR
echo "Backup completed successfully!"
rsync -avz â†’ archive mode, verbose, compressed transfer.

You can schedule this script with cron (like every night at 2am).
