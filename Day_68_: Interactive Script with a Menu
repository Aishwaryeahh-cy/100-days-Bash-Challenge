Idea: Sometimes you want to give the user a choice (like start, stop, restart services).
We can use a simple menu with case statements.

Example script:
#!/bin/bash
# service-menu.sh
echo "Service Menu"
echo "1. Start Apache"
echo "2. Stop Apache"
echo "3. Restart Apache"
echo "4. Exit"
read -p "Enter your choice: " choice
case $choice in
  1) systemctl start apache2 ;;
  2) systemctl stop apache2 ;;
  3) systemctl restart apache2 ;;
  4) echo "Exiting..."; exit 0 ;;
  *) echo "Invalid choice" ;;
esac
If user presses 1, it will start Apache service.
systemctl is used to manage services.
