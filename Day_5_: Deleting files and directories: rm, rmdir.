# rm – Remove Files or Directories
Definition: rm stands for "remove". It's used to delete files and (with a special option) directories.
Example: mkdir NewOne
         touch Newfilehere.txt
         rm Newfilehere.txt(Remove Files or Directories)

#Delete a Folder and Its Contents:
rm -r foldername
The -r means recursive, which allows it to delete the folder and everything inside it.
Example: mkdir Newish
        touch heythere.txt
        rm -r Newish

# rmdir – Remove Empty Directory
Definition: rmdir means "remove directory". It only works if the folder is empty.
Example: mkdir Empty folder
         rmdir Empty folder (deletes the folder only if it has nothing inside).
