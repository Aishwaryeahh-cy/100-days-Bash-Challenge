# User and Group Ownership (chown, chgrp)
In Linux, ownership is an important part of file permissions and security. Each file and directory is owned by:
A user (owner)
A group
CHOWN (USER ND SOMETIMES GROUP)
CHGRP (ONLY FILE)
Example for chown: sudo chown bob report.txt (nly user)
                   sudo chown bob:admins report.txt (both user and group) 

Example for chgrp: sudo chgrp testers report.txt
