# Hard Links and Symbolic Links (ln)
1. Hard Links
If the original file is deleted, the data is still accessible via the hard link.
Example : ln existing_file hard_link_name
          ln notes.txt backup_notes.txt

2. Symbolic Links 
If the original is deleted, the symlink becomes broken.
Example: ln -s existing_file symlink_name
